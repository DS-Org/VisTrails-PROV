Keywords
- Provenance
- Workflow Evolution
- Visualization

We provide provenance traces for the following workflows, in the domain of scientific and information visualization:

- head.vt
- terminator.vt
- protein_visualization.vt
- infovis.vt
- brain.vt
- offscreen.vt

Each workflow has its corresponding folder, and each folder contains the traces together with the original workflow that produced them. We include traces for prospective provenance (each workflow version has its own trace), retrospective provenance (execution of the workflow) and workflow evolution.

In addition, we also provide some traces (workflow evolution) generated by the VisTrails plugin for Autodesk Maya. All the traces are included in the folder "plugin_traces".
